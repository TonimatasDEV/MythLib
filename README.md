# MythLib
**Please note that this library is in its early stages and is likely to change drastically with the first updates.**

## Description
Cross-Platform library for minecraft mod development. Based on Architectury API, ResourcefulLib and Botarium.

MythLib was planned to be a library used for my projects but I think it can be useful for many developers when creating mods for Fabric + Forge. 

## Features
- [x] Registry
- [x] Networking
- [x] Fluid and Energy API compatible with any other mod.
- [ ] MORE THINGS
